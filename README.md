# `knowledges about this subject`
### 1. vm & virtuallisation
A `virtual machine (VM)` is the virtualization or emulation of 
a physical computer system.


A VM is created on a physical machine, a regular server with physical 
computer components like CPU cores, a motherboard, RAM, storage disks, 
a GPU, and more.Depending on the type of hypervisor, this server
 either has an operating system (OS) installed or runs with a 
bare-metal hypervisor without an OS.

#### 1.1 Hyperviseur
A hypervisor is a software that you can use to run multiple virtual machines on a single physical machine. Every virtual machine has its own operating system and applications. The hypervisor allocates the underlying physical computing resources such as CPU and memory to individual virtual machines as required

 #### 1.2 How the virtual machine work

 A virtual machine (VM) is like a computer within a computer. It's software that emulates a physical computer and runs its own operating system and applications. The host machine provides the resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage, and the VM uses these resources to operate independently. This allows multiple VMs to run on a single physical machine, each with its own isolated environment, making it useful for testing, development, and running multiple operating systems on the same hardware.

 ### 3. What is The purpose of virtual machines. ?

 The purpose of virtual machines is to maximize hardware utilization and flexibility by allowing multiple operating systems and applications to run independently on a single physical machine. This enables easier management, better resource allocation, and more efficient use of computing resources for tasks like testing, development, and running diverse software environments.
